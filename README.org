* YAML utilities

Have a common and simplistic subset of YAML elements for some of my
cloud needs available. Basically filling the gap between annoyance of
string dancing to what templating acrobatics provide minus the nasty
"oh, let's just indent it and hope it be the correct amount".

Uses "gopkg.in/yaml.v3" and wraps some structs around it.

* Usage

Uses Go 1.18 (as this is what I use with pulumi right now) and a

go get github.com/nelbrecht/cyaml should get you going.
